# z64scene format specification

I never wrote the format specification...

Please refer to `types.h` and `z64scene.c`. The code has been
commented thoroughly. An example scene file I crafted in a hex
editor has also been included. It utilizes most of the features
available, and you can learn a lot about how it works by stepping
through the code while looking at the file in a hex editor.
